## üöÄ Setup & Usage

Since "Co Search" is a client-side HTML file, setup is incredibly straightforward!

### Prerequisites

* A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc.)
* The image file `R (3).png` (this is used as the background image for the page). Make sure it's in the **same directory** as your `index.html` file, or update the `background-image` path in the CSS.

### Steps

1.  **Save the file**:
    Save the provided HTML code as `index.html` (or any `.html` filename you prefer) on your computer.
2.  **Place the background image**:
    Ensure the image file named `R (3).png` is in the same folder as your `index.html` file. If your image has a different name or is in a subfolder, you'll need to update the `background-image: url('R (3).png');` line in the `<style>` section of your `index.html`.
3.  **Open in Browser**:
    Simply double-click the `index.html` file. It will open in your default web browser.

That's it! You can now start typing in the search box and press "Search" or Enter to look up information on Google.

## üé® Customization

You can easily customize this page to your liking:

* **Background Image**: Change `url('R (3).png')` in the CSS to the path of any image you prefer.
* **Colors**: Modify `background-color: #00ff08;` and `background-color: #00e007;` for the button to change its color. You can also adjust the `color` and `text-shadow` of the `<h1>` tag.
* **Search Engine**: To use a different search engine (e.g., DuckDuckGo, Bing), you would change the `action` attribute in the `<form>` tag and potentially the `name="q"` attribute of the input field to match the new search engine's requirements.
